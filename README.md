# Weather-Forecast-Application-Project
Developed a main page that displays the current weather for a default city (e.g., New York). • Implement a search functionality that allows users to look up weather information for different cities. • Utilize a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time data.
